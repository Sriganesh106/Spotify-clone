# Spotify-clone
Built a responsive Spotify clone using HTML and CSS, featuring playlists, album art, and a media player. This project helped me enhance my frontend skills and taught me how to design interfaces that work well on different devices. Eager to continue learning and growing in both frontend and backend development.
